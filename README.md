Title: Solar Tracking System using Arduino Uno R3, Stepper Motors (28BYJ-48), ULN2803, and LDR Sensors 

Abstract: The solar tracking system is an essential technology that enables solar panels to maximize their efficiency by orienting towards the sun throughout the day. This report presents a detailed analysis and design of a solar tracking system utilizing an Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller, two stepper motors (28BYJ-48), ULN2803 driver IC, and four Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs). The system aims to optimize the solar panel's position to ensure maximum exposure to sunlight, resulting in increased energy generation. This report covers the theoretical background, system design, hardware implementation, software programming, calibration, testing, and performance evaluation of the solar tracking system.
